Shopgoodwill scraper

- Flask app
- Use config file internally for selecting keywords and modes
- Use Apprise to notify users, I plan on using sendgrid
- Store data in two csv files, one for history of all scraped pages
  and another for the current batch that will be used to notify users
  ( Long term: use SQLite or NoSQL database, possibly Oracle's options)

- Data format:
        ID, title, expiration timestamp

- Actually put a python init file in for once
- Dockerize this (conflicts with using Oracle DB)

---
After MVP:
Add support for multiple profiles with different notifiers
Add more modes and config options (price compare mode, notify only when one day left on auction, etc.)
